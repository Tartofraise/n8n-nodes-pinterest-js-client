![n8n.io - Workflow Automation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/n8n-io/n8n/master/assets/n8n-logo.png)

This is an n8n community node that lets you use [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com) in your n8n workflows using the powerful [pinterest-js-client](https://github.com/Tartofraise/pinterest-js-client) library with advanced stealth features.

[n8n](https://n8n.io/) is a [fair-code licensed](https://docs.n8n.io/reference/license/) workflow automation platform.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: This node is designed for **self-hosted n8n instances only**. It requires the `pinterest-js-client` dependency with Puppeteer for browser-based authentication, which is not supported on n8n Cloud due to dependency restrictions.
